After you complete each task commit your changes, remove the task from this todo list and start the next task

- Don't print the tables manually, find a crate that can do it for us already
- Do a general codebase cleanup. Looks for quality improvements to be made and to dry it up
- Add an export command that can support multiple types of export. Allow writing to a file or to stdout
    - To start, make a DOT graph export, so we can see all the keys and the hosts they are attached to
    - Also make a CSV exporter
