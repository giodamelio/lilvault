After you complete each task commit your changes, remove the task from this todo list and start the next task

- The main file is getting a bit bit, reorganize it into seperate modules by subcommand
- Don't print the tables manually, find a crate that can do it for us already
- Do a general codebase cleanup. Looks for quality improvements to be made and to dry it up
